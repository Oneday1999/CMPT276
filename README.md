**Competitive Analysis:**
Firstly, while competitors might offer monthly summaries, few maintain a comprehensive
historical transaction repository. This allows users of "AccountAble" to delve deeper into
their financial history, providing a holistic view of their financial journey. Secondly,
"AccountAble" prides itself on its user-centric design. This means intuitive navigation, clear
layouts, and a seamless experience. Many competitors either clutter their interfaces with ads
or unnecessary features, or they lack the streamlined design that "AccountAble" offers.
However, AccountAble still has some weaknesses. For instance, Only being exclusive to the
Android platform might limit its user base, and future accounting programs entering the
market might borrow our unique features, affecting user share.
